# Wind Turbines relaunched
## Features
Wind Turbines produce free energy, but are expensive to build and don't have a steady output.
This mod adds 4 tiers of turbines, from a small wooden windmill to a giant steel and refined concrete turbine.

![wind turbines](https://github.com/xyzzycgn/Wind-Turbines-relaunched/blob/main/turbines.jpg?raw=true)
- Alternative/complement to solar panel arrays, similar large upfront cost but free energy after
- The higher tier versions save a lot of space compared to solar panel arrays
- You can walk around the base tower, but you cannot build there to avoid objects getting hidden behind the 
  large graphics (depends on settings)

## Configuration options
There are several options you can use to configure behaviour of this mod.
- Wind strength factor  
  Multiplier for energy production. Allowed range is 1 - 10, defaults to 1.

- Enable the Giant turbine  
  Allows disabling the Giant wind turbine for low-end computers where the large graphics might cause problems. 
  Giant wind turbine is enabled by default.

- Surface determines wind strength (since version 2.1.0)   
  Uses wind strength determined by the surface (individual for each surface) changing in a more random based manner
  instead of the original periodic function with identical values of wind strength on all surfaces. Enabled by default.

- Wind turbines take up more space (since version 2.1.0)    
  If enabled, the space behind the wind turbines is reserved, so that nothing can be built there (classical behaviour, 
  disabled by default).

## Quality
Quality (introduced by SPA) is supported. The different quality tiers offer increased health and energy output.
Increase of energy output is analogous to that of a solar panel.

## Supported locales
As of version 2.0.1 several locales are supported. Currently these are:
- čeština (cs)
- deutsch (de)
- ελληνικά (el)
- english (en) - default

## Relaunch of Wind Turbines from wavtrex with the necessary patches for V 2.0 of factorio.
This mod is intended as inplace replacement for [Wind_Generator-gfxrestyle](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Wind_Generator-gfxrestyle) 
which is no longer compatible with V 2.0 of factorio.
