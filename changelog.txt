---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.2
Date: 2025-03-01
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed inconsistency with space age extension (turbines could be build on space platforms, but in space there is
      no wind 😉).
      Now turbines can only be build on planets, with the exception of aquilo (pressure too low) and wooden mills are
      not possible on vulcanus.

  Changes:
    - Ability to disable the Titanic wind turbine (for low-end PCs where the big graphics might cause issues)
    - Basic Windmill is now researched by default and can be hand crafted without any research (to skip polluting boilers completely)
    - Significantly increased max power output (from 40 to 67), resulting in an average of "45" units (kW+)
    - Significantly reduced build cost of Windmill, and to a lesser degree the Wind generator and Wind turbine
    - Altered health amounts and resistances, the higher tiers are very durable
    - Significantly increased the internal capacitor for all wind generators to better assist with wind speed fluctuation
  Bugfixes:
    - Wind Generator research now uses only one Automation research per cycle
    - Further optimized graphics to reduce mod size
  Locale:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.5
Date: 2021-12-06
  Changes:

    - Altered recipes to better fit the tech tree progression and better balance with other power production facilities
    - All four variants are now heavier on iron and lighter on copper
    - Wind generator no longer requires electric engine units (instead recycles mechanical engines and four steel poles into its guts)
    - Wind turbine no longer requires drone frames (that didn't make much sense) but instead more electric engine units; It now also needs lots of plastic to build
    - Titanic wind turbine now needs and recycles nuclear tech (by converting 10 steam turbines into one giant wind turbine)
  Bugfixes:
    - Restored some missing initialization code

    - Altered recipes for better progression with technology advancements:
    - Windmill: 20 Wood electric poles instead of raw wood; Reduced number of electronics; Added gears and decreased iron plates
    - Wind generator: Requires plastic instead of steel; Reduced advanced circuits to 10; Requires steel power pole instead of substation
    - Wind turbine: Requires 100 Low Density Structures; Reduced amount of steel to 300; Reduced processing units from 25 to 20; Flying robot frames increased from 25 to 30; Needs one steam turbine; Removed gears
