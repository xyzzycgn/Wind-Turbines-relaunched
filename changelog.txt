---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.6
Date: 2022-03-04
  Changes:
    - Ability to disable the Titanic wind turbine (for low-end PCs where the big graphics might cause issues)
    - Basic Windmill is now researched by default and can be hand crafted without any research (to skip polluting boilers completely)
    - Significantly increased max power output (from 40 to 67), resulting in an average of "45" units (kW+)
    - Significantly reduced build cost of Windmill, and to a lesser degree the Wind generator and Wind turbine
    - Altered health amounts and resistances, the higher tiers are very durable
    - Significantly increased the internal capacitor for all wind generators to better assist with wind speed fluctuation
  Bugfixes:
    - Wind Generator research now uses only one Automation research per cycle
    - Further optimized graphics to reduce mod size
  Locale:
    - Removed old russian and chinese locale as it was outdated and did not match anymore the recent changes
    - Name changed to "Wind Turbines" in the settings file
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.5
Date: 2021-12-06
  Changes:
    - Altered research to allow completing the game purely on wind power with all variants (no more space science):
    - Windmill uses automation research only; Wind generator is now logistics research; Wind turbine is chemical research; Titanic wind turbine is utility research
    - Altered recipes to better fit the tech tree progression and better balance with other power production facilities
    - All four variants are now heavier on iron and lighter on copper
    - Wind generator no longer requires electric engine units (instead recycles mechanical engines and four steel poles into its guts)
    - Wind turbine no longer requires drone frames (that didn't make much sense) but instead more electric engine units; It now also needs lots of plastic to build
    - Titanic wind turbine now needs and recycles nuclear tech (by converting 10 steam turbines into one giant wind turbine)
  Bugfixes:
    - Restored some missing initialization code
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.4
Date: 2021-12-06
  Changes:
    - English localization: Renamed the first three tiers into: "Windmill", "Wind generator", "Wind turbine";
    - Windmill now requires 50 logistics+automation research to enable
    - Altered recipes for better progression with technology advancements:
    - Windmill: 20 Wood electric poles instead of raw wood; Reduced number of electronics; Added gears and decreased iron plates
    - Wind generator: Requires plastic instead of steel; Reduced advanced circuits to 10; Requires steel power pole instead of substation
    - Wind turbine: Requires 100 Low Density Structures; Reduced amount of steel to 300; Reduced processing units from 25 to 20; Flying robot frames increased from 25 to 30; Needs one steam turbine; Removed gears
    - Tweaked graphics for Windmill: Lighter wood shade and edge anti-aliasing
    - New item icons for Windmill and Wind generator; More visible icons for the other two
    - Adjusted hitboxes to better match the graphics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2021-12-05
  Changes:
    - Truly removed hidden power poles
    - Converted all turbines to Electric Energy Interfaces instead of generators, eliminating fluid boxes.
    - Removed the old sound, as it was too loud with several turbines together. (Will get replaced with a more appropriate "whoosh" sound in the future)
