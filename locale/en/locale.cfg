[mod-setting-name]
texugo-wind-power=Wind strength factor
texugo-wind-turbine4=Enable the Giant turbine
texugo-wind-extended-collision-area=Wind turbines take up more space
texugo-wind-mode=Determination of wind strength
texugo-wind-expensive-recipes=higher construction costs

[mod-setting-description]
texugo-wind-power=Energy production multiplier\nDefault: 1 = 40/400/4000/40000 kW
texugo-wind-turbine4=Allows disabling the Giant wind turbine for low-end computers where the large graphics might cause problems
texugo-wind-extended-collision-area=If enabled, the space behind the wind turbines is reserved so that nothing can be built there
texugo-wind-mode=Mode how wind strength is determined
texugo-wind-expensive-recipes=The construction of the turbines requires more resources

[string-mod-setting]
texugo-wind-mode-CLASSICAL=classical
texugo-wind-mode-SURFACE=surface
texugo-wind-mode-SURFACE+PRESSURE=surface + pressure

[string-mod-setting-description]
texugo-wind-mode-CLASSICAL=Use the original (periodic) function, the same value applies to all surfaces
texugo-wind-mode-SURFACE=Each surface has its own (random) wind strength
texugo-wind-mode-SURFACE+PRESSURE=Every surface has its own (random) wind strength. Energy yield is influenced by atmospheric pressure (increases at higher pressure and decreases at lower pressure).

[alerts]
texugo-wind-extended-collision-area=Had to be dismantled due to distance conflict with another object
texugo-wind-not-connected=not connected to any electricity network
texugo-wind-mode-set=Wind mode set to __1__
