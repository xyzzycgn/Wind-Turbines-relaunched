texugo-wind-power=Energy production multiplier\nDefault: 1 = 40/400/4000/40000 kW
texugo-wind-turbine4=Allow disabling the Giant wind turbine for low-end computers where the large graphics might cause problems
texugo-wind-use-surface-wind-speed=Uses the wind strength determined by the surface instead of the original (periodic) function
texugo-wind-extended-collision-area=If enabled, the space behind the wind turbines is reserved so that nothing can be built there
