[mod-setting-name]
texugo-wind-power=Wind strength factor
texugo-wind-turbine4=Enable the Giant turbine
texugo-wind-use-surface-wind-speed=Surface determines wind strength
texugo-wind-scale-with-pressure=Energy production scales with atmospheric pressure
texugo-wind-extended-collision-area=Wind turbines take up more space

[mod-setting-description]
texugo-wind-power=Energy production multiplier\nDefault: 1 = 40/400/4000/40000 kW
texugo-wind-turbine4=Allows disabling the Giant wind turbine for low-end computers where the large graphics might cause problems
texugo-wind-use-surface-wind-speed=Uses the wind strength determined by the surface instead of the original (periodic) function
texugo-wind-scale-with-pressure=The energy yield is influenced by the atmospheric pressure (increases at higher and decreases at lower pressure).
texugo-wind-extended-collision-area=If enabled, the space behind the wind turbines is reserved so that nothing can be built there

[alerts]
texugo-wind-extended-collision-area=Had to be dismantled due to distance conflict with another object
texugo-wind-not-connected=not connected to any electricity network
